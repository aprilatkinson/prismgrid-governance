# PrismGrid

**PrismGrid is the governance and diagnostic layer for modern marketing systems.**

Marketing teams today use a mix of:
- AI agents
- chat-based AI tools
- automated workflows
- traditional competitive intelligence platforms

These tools are excellent at **speed**.

They are weak at **validity, accountability, and auditability**.

PrismGrid exists to solve that gap.

## What PrismGrid Does

PrismGrid produces a **deterministic, evidence-backed diagnostic snapshot** that answers one question:

> **Does the positioning we are about to scale structurally hold up against observable market reality — or does a contradiction exist that should be resolved first?**

It evaluates:
- What a brand and product claim
- How competitors earn trust in the same category
- How customers and the market publicly reinforce or contradict those claims

All conclusions are grounded in **explicit evidence lineage**.

PrismGrid does **not** execute changes, generate copy, or predict performance.

## How PrismGrid Fits Into Modern Stacks

PrismGrid does **not replace** your tools.

It **governs them**.

- Your AI agents generate ideas → PrismGrid verifies them
- Your workflows accelerate execution → PrismGrid constrains risk
- Your dashboards show performance → PrismGrid explains credibility gaps

**Velocity without validity is how brands drift.**  
PrismGrid prevents silent drift before it compounds.

## The Three-Layer Model

PrismGrid is intentionally structured into three layers:

### 1. Canonical Diagnostic Layer (Truth)
A frozen, deterministic snapshot of observable market reality.
- Computes diagnosis, severity, confidence
- Immutable once generated
- Board-safe and regulator-safe

### 2. Thinking Space (Interpretation)
A non-canonical, explanatory layer.
- Explains *why* a diagnosis exists
- Supports legal, brand, and executive review
- Cannot change scores, labels, or evidence

### 3. Growth Workspace (Validation)
A planning-only layer for execution teams.
- Prioritizes what to act on first
- Validates proposed claims as ALLOWED / RESTRICTED / BLOCKED
- Never executes, predicts, or optimizes

Each layer has strict authority boundaries.

## What PrismGrid Is Not

PrismGrid is not:
- a chatbot
- a copy generator
- a competitive monitoring feed
- a continuous tracking system
- a growth optimization engine
- a forecasting platform
- a performance guarantee

It is a **diagnostic and governance system**.

---

## Who This Is For

PrismGrid is built for teams that must defend decisions, not just move fast:

- Enterprise marketing leadership
- Legal and compliance teams
- AI governance owners
- Regulated or brand-sensitive categories
- Organizations scaling AI-driven execution

---

## Status

This repository contains **public-facing governance, architecture, and diagnostic principles**.

It does not expose proprietary scoring logic or execution pipelines.

---

**PrismGrid: Scale truth. Not contradictions.**
