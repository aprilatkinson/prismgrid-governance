# Who PrismGrid Is For (and Who It Is Not)

PrismGrid is intentionally narrow.

It is built for teams that need **defensible decisions**, not faster opinions.

If that sounds restrictive, it is — by design.

## PrismGrid Is For

### Enterprise & Regulated Marketing Teams

PrismGrid is for organizations where marketing decisions must survive:
- executive scrutiny
- legal review
- regulatory inquiry
- long decision cycles
- AI governance oversight
- public brand scrutiny and reputational risk

This includes teams operating in:
- health & wellness products
- consumer fintech products (public-facing marketing only)
- insurance products with customer-facing claims
- marketplaces and platforms with public trust and quality claims
- global consumer brands
- hardware and regulated physical products (marketing and positioning diagnostics only)

These teams cannot rely on:
> “The AI said so.”

They need **evidence-backed justification**.

---

### AI-Driven Organizations Scaling Claims

PrismGrid is for teams that already use:
- AI agents
- chat-based AI tools
- automated content workflows
- competitive intelligence platforms
- CRO and experimentation systems

And have discovered a hard truth:

> Speed increases output — but also increases risk.

PrismGrid exists to **govern acceleration**, not slow it down.

---
### High-Velocity Marketing Teams (With or Without AI)

PrismGrid is also for organizations that are scaling content and paid media aggressively — even if they are not yet using AI agents.

These teams often experience the same failure mode as AI-driven systems:

- multiple teams publishing simultaneously
- agencies operating with partial context
- campaigns evolving faster than proof
- claims drifting across regions and surfaces
- contradictions compounding quietly over time

The result is not one bad decision — it is **silent brand drift**.

PrismGrid provides a diagnostic anchor that keeps high-velocity marketing aligned with observable market reality, before contradictions are scaled beyond control.

### Leaders Accountable for Risk, Not Just Growth

PrismGrid is for:
- CMOs and VPs of Marketing
- Heads of Brand and Product Marketing
- Digital Marketing & E-commerce Leaders
- Legal and Compliance partners
- AI governance owners
- Executive leadership teams

If a decision must be **defensible months later**, PrismGrid is relevant.

---

## PrismGrid Is Not For

### Growth Hackers Looking for Shortcuts

PrismGrid is not for teams asking:
- “What headline will convert best?”
- “Can you write better copy?”
- “What’s the expected uplift?”
- “Which variant should we ship today?”

It does not generate winning tactics.
It does not promise performance.

---

### Teams Who Want Automation Without Accountability

If your goal is:
- autonomous publishing
- AI-driven execution
- rapid experimentation without review
- continuous optimization loops

PrismGrid will feel restrictive.

That is intentional.

---

### Users Seeking Certainty or Guarantees

PrismGrid does not:
- certify compliance
- declare claims “safe”
- predict outcomes
- remove human responsibility

If you want an AI to **replace judgment**, PrismGrid is the wrong system.

---

## The Litmus Test

PrismGrid is right for you if this statement resonates:

> “We move fast — but we need to know *what not to scale*.”

If instead you’re asking:

> “How do we get more output faster?”

You will be better served elsewhere.

---

## Why This Boundary Exists

Most AI tools optimize for **velocity**.

PrismGrid optimizes for **credibility under acceleration**.

That tradeoff is not for everyone.

And that’s exactly why PrismGrid exists.
