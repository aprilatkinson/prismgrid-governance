# PrismGrid Disagreement Protocol (MVP)

## Purpose

To resolve disagreement with a PrismGrid diagnostic without reverting to opinion or hierarchy.

---

## Step 1: Classify the Disagreement

All disagreements fall into one category:

### Input Gap
“The diagnostic missed a relevant public signal.”

→ Add the source and re-run.

### Intent Gap
“Our intent is premium, but perception is value.”

→ Accept the gap or address the primary fix.

### Signal Gap
“This evidence is not representative.”

→ Demonstrate, using public data, that it is an outlier.

---

## Step 2: Show Your Work

To dispute a finding, answer:
- What public signal contradicts it?
- Are we disputing the diagnosis or the sequencing?
- Are we defending belief or observable reality?

---

## Step 3: Choose a Path

- Re-run with new inputs
- Accept diagnosis, change execution
- Accept diagnosis, shift strategy

---

## Authority Boundary

PrismGrid identifies misalignment.
Teams design execution.
Executives decide tradeoffs.
