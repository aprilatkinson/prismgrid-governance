# PrismGrid Identity

## What PrismGrid Is

PrismGrid is a competitive diagnosis system.

It evaluates how a brand’s stated positioning, competitor positioning, and observable market signals align or contradict each other.

It produces a **deterministic diagnostic artifact** that enables decision-makers to understand:
- where credibility is earned
- where claims are unsupported
- where structural contradictions exist
- what must be resolved first before scaling

Every conclusion is grounded in **explicit evidence lineage**.

---

## Unit of Value

The unit of value is a single diagnostic run.

A run is:
- bounded
- repeatable
- schema-validated
- deterministic
- explainable via evidence lineage

A successful run increases decision confidence by **removing ambiguity**, not by generating ideas.

## What PrismGrid Is Not

PrismGrid is not:
- a chatbot
- a copy generator
- a competitive monitoring feed
- a continuous tracking system
- a growth optimization engine
- a forecasting platform
- a performance guarantee

---

## Engineering Philosophy (Public)

- Determinism over cleverness
- Evidence over inference
- Snapshot over patch
- Explanation over speculation
- Explicit uncertainty over false confidence

If something cannot be derived from public evidence, it is marked **unknown**.

---

## Tone

PrismGrid is calm, precise, and restrained.

Its outputs should feel like:
- a diagnostic report
- a system integrity check
- a decision artifact

Not marketing copy.
