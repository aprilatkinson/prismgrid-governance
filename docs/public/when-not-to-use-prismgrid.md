# When **Not** to Use PrismGrid

PrismGrid is a specialized diagnostic system.
It is intentionally narrow by design.

If your primary goal falls into any of the categories below, PrismGrid is **not** the right tool.

This is not a limitation — it is a boundary that preserves diagnostic integrity.

## Do **Not** Use PrismGrid If You Want…

### 1. Faster Content Production

If your goal is to:

* generate ad copy
* write landing pages
* produce SEO articles
* spin variations at scale

PrismGrid is not designed for this.

There are many excellent tools optimized for **content velocity**.
PrismGrid is optimized for **content validity**.

---

### 2. Performance Forecasting or Growth Guarantees

If you expect answers like:

* “This will increase conversion by X%”
* “This variant will outperform the control”
* “This messaging will reduce churn”
* “This claim is compliant / safe”

PrismGrid must not be used.

PrismGrid does **not**:

* predict outcomes
* estimate lift
* model revenue
* certify compliance
* declare safety or legality

Any tool that promises those outcomes is operating outside PrismGrid’s design philosophy.

---

### 3. Autonomous Execution or Automation

If you are looking for:

* AI that publishes ads
* AI that pushes CMS updates
* AI that deploys experiments
* AI that self-optimizes based on results

PrismGrid is not an execution system.

It never:

* holds credentials
* triggers publishing
* closes feedback loops
* learns from performance outcomes

Execution authority always remains human-owned.

---

### 4. Continuous Monitoring or Real-Time Alerts

If you want:

* always-on dashboards
* live alerts
* automatic re-scans
* background monitoring

PrismGrid MVP is not designed for that mode.

Each PrismGrid run is:

* explicit
* intentional
* snapshot-based
* time-bounded

This ensures interpretability and prevents silent drift.

---

### 5. Subjective Brand Opinions

If you want:

* aesthetic judgments
* creative taste feedback
* tone preferences
* “this feels better” guidance

PrismGrid will disappoint you.

It does not evaluate:

* style
* creativity
* originality
* emotional resonance

It evaluates **structural alignment between claims and observable reality**.

---

### 6. Proof That You Are “Right”

If the goal is to:

* validate internal belief
* justify a pre-chosen strategy
* win an internal argument without evidence

PrismGrid is the wrong tool.

It is designed to:

* surface contradictions
* expose weak assumptions
* make disagreement explicit and evidence-based

Not to confirm prior opinions.

---

## When PrismGrid *Is* the Right Tool

PrismGrid should be used when:

* Marketing decisions must survive executive scrutiny
* Claims must withstand legal or regulatory review
* Multiple teams or agencies risk drifting out of alignment
* AI systems are generating content faster than trust can be validated
* Public brand credibility is more valuable than short-term speed

If none of those constraints apply, simpler tools are usually better.

---

## Final Boundary

PrismGrid exists to make **bad decisions harder**
—not to make decisions faster.

If speed, automation, or prediction is the priority,
you should choose a different system.

If **defensibility**, **evidence**, and **governed scale** matter,
PrismGrid is designed for exactly that.
