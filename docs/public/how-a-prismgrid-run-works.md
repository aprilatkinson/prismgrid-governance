# How a PrismGrid Diagnostic Works (Public Overview)

A PrismGrid run is a **deterministic, snapshot-based diagnostic**.

It resolves misalignment between:
- what a brand claims
- how its product is framed across public surfaces
- how customers and the market publicly respond

Each run produces a **single immutable diagnostic snapshot**.

## The Question PrismGrid Answers

Every run answers exactly one question:

> **Does the current positioning structurally hold up against observable market reality, or does a contradiction exist that should be resolved before scaling?**

PrismGrid does not attempt to answer:
- how to execute changes
- what copy to write
- what uplift to expect
- whether the product is “good” or “bad”

---

## Inputs (Public Signals Only)

Each run uses a minimal set of explicit, user-declared inputs:
- Target brand or product surface
- Declared market context
- Optional competitors for comparison
- Optional public marketplaces (e.g. Amazon)

PrismGrid **never** ingests:
- internal analytics
- CRM data
- ad accounts
- revenue figures
- strategic intent
- private or authenticated sources

## Execution Model (Abstracted)

A PrismGrid run executes through a deterministic, multi-stage diagnostic pipeline that:
1. Freezes the declared scope and public sources
2. Extracts claims and observable market signals
3. Compares promises to reinforcement patterns
4. Computes a single diagnosis, severity, and confidence
5. Surfaces one primary structural fix

There is:
- no learning
- no adaptation
- no cross-run inference

Identical inputs under identical versions produce identical outputs.

---

## Outputs

Each run produces:
- A single diagnosis label
- A severity band
- A confidence level
- One primary fix that defines sequencing
- Evidence lineage for every conclusion

Confidence degrades when evidence is weak.
Uncertainty is never hidden.

---

## Authority Boundary

PrismGrid is **diagnostically authoritative only**.

It does not:
- authorize execution
- certify compliance
- predict outcomes
- optimize performance

Human judgment remains required.

## Why This Matters

In AI-driven systems, most errors do not come from bad execution.
They come from **scaling the wrong thing confidently**.

PrismGrid exists to stop that — before cost, trust, or regulatory exposure compounds.
