# PrismGrid AI Governance & EU AI Act Position 

This document explains how PrismGrid is designed to operate responsibly in AI-regulated environments, including under the EU AI Act.

It is a **governance position**, not legal advice, certification, or a claim of compliance.

PrismGrid is intentionally designed to **reduce AI-driven risk**, not to replace legal judgment or regulatory processes.

---

## PrismGrid’s Core Governance Principle

**Velocity is not authority.**

PrismGrid is built on the assumption that:
- probabilistic AI systems are useful
- but probabilistic outputs cannot be treated as truth
- especially when decisions scale across teams, markets, and time

PrismGrid therefore separates:
- **diagnostic truth**
- **human interpretation**
- **execution planning**

This separation is the foundation of its AI governance posture.

---

## How PrismGrid Uses AI (and How It Does Not)

PrismGrid uses AI systems only for **bounded extraction tasks**, such as:
- identifying claims from public text
- clustering customer review themes

AI systems are **never** used to:
- determine diagnostic labels
- assign severity
- compute confidence
- authorize actions
- predict outcomes
- declare compliance or safety

All diagnostic judgments are computed by deterministic, rule-based logic operating on extracted signals.

This design intentionally limits AI authority.

## Mapping PrismGrid to EU AI Act Risk Categories

The EU AI Act defines AI systems by **risk category**, not by technical implementation.

Below is PrismGrid’s position relative to those categories.

---

### 1. Prohibited Risk Systems

Prohibited systems include AI that:
- manipulates behavior
- exploits vulnerabilities
- engages in covert persuasion
- performs social scoring

**PrismGrid does not fall into this category.**

PrismGrid:
- does not target individuals
- does not manipulate users
- does not score people or groups
- does not influence behavior directly
- does not perform persuasion or optimization

Its outputs are analytical and descriptive, not manipulative.

---

### 2. High-Risk AI Systems

High-risk systems typically:
- affect fundamental rights
- automate or materially influence regulated decisions
- perform biometric identification
- evaluate individuals for eligibility or access

**PrismGrid is explicitly not a high-risk system.**

Reasons:
- it does not make or automate decisions
- it does not assess individuals
- it does not grant or deny access, credit, employment, or services
- it does not produce legally binding outputs
- it does not replace human judgment

PrismGrid produces **decision support artifacts**, not decisions.

Human accountability is preserved by design.

---

### 3. Limited Risk Systems (Transparency Obligations)

Limited-risk systems require:
- transparency about AI involvement
- clarity that outputs are AI-assisted

**PrismGrid aligns most closely with this category.**

PrismGrid explicitly discloses:
- where AI is used (extraction only)
- where AI is not used (diagnosis, scoring, authority)
- that outputs are not legal, regulatory, or compliance judgments

Thinking Space and Growth Workspace outputs are explicitly labeled as:
- non-canonical
- non-authoritative
- non-executing

This satisfies transparency expectations without overstating capability.

---

### 4. Minimal Risk Systems

Minimal-risk systems include:
- internal analytics
- content organization
- research assistance

Parts of PrismGrid (e.g. extraction and clustering) resemble minimal-risk usage, but the system as a whole is more structured due to its governance role.

PrismGrid therefore treats itself conservatively as **limited risk**, not minimal risk.

---

## Human Oversight & Accountability

PrismGrid is designed to preserve human responsibility at all times.

- Diagnostics surface constraints, not commands
- Recommendations define *what must change*, not *how*
- Growth Workspace validates ideas, but never executes them
- Executive overrides are explicitly documented

No PrismGrid output can:
- approve a claim
- certify compliance
- declare safety
- predict regulatory outcomes

Humans remain accountable for all decisions.

---

## Evidence Lineage & Auditability

Every PrismGrid diagnostic includes:
- explicit evidence references
- immutable snapshots
- replayable inputs
- deterministic outputs per version

This enables:
- internal review
- post-hoc justification
- structured disagreement
- governance oversight

Chat-based AI systems cannot provide this level of traceability.

---

## Confidence Degradation (Anti-Hallucination Design)

When evidence is weak or incomplete, PrismGrid:
- lowers confidence
- marks diagnoses as directional
- refuses to fabricate certainty

This behavior is intentional.

PrismGrid treats **uncertainty as safer than false confidence**, aligning with Responsible AI principles under the EU AI Act.

---

## What PrismGrid Is Not Claiming

PrismGrid does **not** claim to be:
- legally compliant by default
- a regulatory audit tool
- a certification authority
- a substitute for legal review
- a predictor of enforcement outcomes

It is a **risk-aware diagnostic system** designed to support human governance processes.

---

## Why This Matters for Enterprises

As AI accelerates marketing and communication systems:
- decisions are made faster
- fewer humans review each change
- accountability becomes harder to maintain

PrismGrid exists to restore:
- traceability
- decision integrity
- defensibility
- governance clarity

It does so without blocking innovation or execution.

---

## Summary

PrismGrid is designed to:
- coexist with AI systems
- constrain AI authority
- preserve human accountability
- surface risk before it scales
- align with EU AI Act transparency and oversight principles

It is not an AI decision maker.

It is a **governance-first diagnostic layer for AI-accelerated organizations**.
